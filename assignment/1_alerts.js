/**
 * Animal Guessing Game
 * When the page is loaded, the user is prompted to guess an animal.
 * Once they submit their answer the program will either
 * - tell them that they correctly guessed the animal or
 * - that they should try again.
 */

// 1. Create a variable that takes in user input via the prompt function
// that asks "Of what animal am I thinking?".

// var animal =

var animal = prompt("Of what animal am I thinking?");

// 2. Write a conditional statement (if/else) that alerts
// - "How did you know?!" if the user guesses "turtle" or
// - "Try again." if the user did not guess "turtle" correctly.
// IMPORTANT: Use these exact strings: 'Try again.' and 'How did you know?!'.

  if (animal == 'turtle'){
    alert("How did you know?!");
  } else {
    alert("Try again.");
  }

// 3. Refactor your code above into the "animalGuess" function below.
// Refactor means the website should behave the same to the users,
// but the code is written differently.
// Think about the variable "animalName" and how it is different than "animal".
// Call the function by passing the animal variable into it

function animalGuess(animalName) {

  if (animalName == 'turtle'){
    alert("How did you know?!");
  } else {
    alert("Try again.");
  }
  // conditional statement goes in here
}

animalGuess(animal);



// 4. Answer the question: What will "console.log(animalName)" log outside the
// "animalGuess" function?
